    h1 About this app
    p Currently it can do not so much. You can:
    ul
        li register
        li login
        li create a sprint of tasks
        li mark your tasks done or delete them
        li edit your sprint if needed
        li mark your spring complete


    p It is more or less mobile friendly, but frankly speaking I haven't put much effort into that.

    p On the roadmap:

    ul
        li ability to see the stats, i.e. how many timespans I have spent on this task and category.
        li ability to assign the timespan to each task. I.e in "Work out" task I will need an hour as each timespan,
            |while in "MongoDB for DBA" course I will need each timespan to equal 2.5 hours, since this is the length of a lesson.
            |As a results I will be able to calculate how many time I have spent on this or that task. As you know they say "You need 10 000 hours to become a professional".
            | So I will be able to see how far away I am from that point :)
